<p class="intro">
There's this voice inside my head that tells me everything I make has to be "just right" before it can be good. This is Goldilocks, and even though she lives in my head, she's a real pain in my ass.
</p>

<p class="post-body">
In small doses, Goldilocks' influence can be positive. She's picky and wants the best solution. However, giving her high standards too much power leads to lots of disappointment â€“ especially when starting something new.</p>

<p class="post-body">
For me, that something new is front-end programming. Like most people, I wasn't born knowing how to build beautiful websites from scratch. Yet if you ask Goldie, every HTML and CSS file I touch should look like I've been doing this for years rather than a few months.</p>

<p class="post-body">
Goldie has overstayed her welcome, and since I don't have three disgruntled grizzlies to scare her away, I'll be using these three tactics:</p>

<p class="post-body">
<ul>
	<li>
		<h2>Quantity</h2>
		<p class="post-body">
			I wouldn't normally choose quantity over quality, but at this point in my web design career (i.e. the beginning), making a lot of wonky websites is the only way I'll learn how to make wonderful ones. If I want to improve the final proudct, I have to make a lot of prototypes. If I want to make badass art, I have to make tons of bad art. If I want to be great, I need to stop trying to be good. As Austin Kleon said, "<span class="italics">good</span> can be a stifling word, a word that makes you hesitate and stare at a blank page and second-guess yourself and throw stuff in the trash. What's important is to get your hands moving and let the images come. Whether it's good or bad is beside the point. Make art."</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Transparency</h2>
		<p class="post-body">
			But what's the point of making art if it stays on my Desktop forever? Well on one hand, no one can criticize my work if they can't actually see it. On the other hand, my work won't improve as much or as fast without feedback. I've seen enough Oscar speeches to know that success isn't singular. There's a reason the winners spend five minutes thanking faceless people. People, maybe with the exception of Drake, don't start from the bottom and rise to the top on their own. And in order to get help, I have to be open about what I'm working on. Showing the work is nearly as important as doing it.

	<li>
		<h2>Kindness</h2>
		<p class="post-body">
			My final plan of attack is to kill Goldie with kindness. Receiving outside criticism is one thing. Being self-critical is another. I don't need the latter right now. This isn't a time for censorship; it's a time for expermimentation, which means failure is bound to happen. If I'm going to keep on truckin', then I've got to show myself some compassion. 
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="post-body">
I hate goodbyes, but I think this one is just right.</p>	
		
<p class="post-body" id="thanks">		
Thanks to Trent Walton for the site design inspiration and to Austin Kleon for inspiring me to steal it. Someday I'll come up with my own, but until then, I'm imitating those who know best.</p>
