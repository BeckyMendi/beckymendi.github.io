<p class="intro" id="excerpt">
There's this voice inside my head that tells me everything I make has to be "just right" before it can be good. This is Goldilocks, and even though she lives in my head, she's a real pain in my ass.
</p>

<p class="post-body">
In small doses, Goldilocks' influence can be positive. She's picky and wants the best solution. However, giving her high standards too much power can lead to disappointment â€“ especially when starting something new.</p>

<p class="post-body">
For me, that something new is front-end programming. About three months ago, I started taking an in-person course on HTML, CSS and JavaScript called MakerSquare. The class meets twice a week for three hours and is structured around projects. For example, creating this blog was a project designed to teach us how to use Jekyll, a Ruby-based software that turns your HTML files into static sites. Since Jekyll is written in Ruby, getting comfortable with it has been challenging, something Goldie doesn't quite understand.</p>

<p class="post-body">
  Jekyll is already driving me a little mad. I sure don't need Goldie's bullying on top of it. Unfortunately, I don't have three disgruntled grizzlies to get rid of her for me. Instead, I'll be using these three tactics to kick Goldie to the curb.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<h2>Quantity</h2>
		<p class="post-body">
			I wouldn't normally choose quantity over quality, but at this point in my web design career (i.e. the starting point), making a lot of ugly websites is the only way I'll learn how to make wonderful ones. If I want to improve the final proudct, I have to make a lot of prototypes. If I want to make badass art, I have to make tons of bad art. If I want to be great, I need to stop trying to be good. As Austin Kleon said, "<span class="italics">good</span> can be a stifling word, a word that makes you hesitate and stare at a blank page and second-guess yourself and throw stuff in the trash. What's important is to get your hands moving. Whether it's good or bad is beside the point. Make art."</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Transparency</h2>
		<p class="post-body">
			But what good is art if it stays on my Desktop forever? Well on one hand, no one can criticize my work if they can't actually see it. On the other hand, my work won't improve as much or as fast without feedback. I'm beginning to realize that success isn't singular. (There's a reason Oscar winners spend five minutes thanking a long list of people.) If I want to get help, I have to be open about what I'm working on, because as it turns out, showing the work is nearly as important as doing it.

	<li>
		<h2>Kindness</h2>
		<p class="post-body">
			My final plan of attack is to kill her with kindness. Receiving outside criticism is one thing. Being self-critical is another. I don't need the latter right now. This isn't a time for censorship; it's a time for expermimentation, which means failure is bound to happen. And if I want to bounce back from it, I've got to show myself some compassion. Because at this early stage, getting things wrong is <span class="italics">just right</span>.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="post-body" id="thanks">		
Thanks to Trent Walton for the design inspiration and to Austin Kleon for inspiring me to steal it. Someday I'll come up with my own style, but until then, I'm imitating those who know best.</p>
